<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So I first
got involved with the Christian Church circa 1979. I had a philosophy
of sorts. A eclectic mix of all sorts, from Aristotle,Plato to Nietze
and Sartre. Plus a large dose of the existential writers even
including Soren Kierkegaard. Not forgetting a larger helping of
Buddism, Sufis and hinduism. Even the Maharishi and the Gita. Not
forgetting the Sociology of Knowledge.Not forgetting massive doses of
music.  However one thing I still lacked was a healthy dose of
sceptisim and cynicism. In other words I was totally gullible. I
believed anyone, Even con men and women. So when I was skint and
alone in a foreign country I was impressed into the Christian Church
as they were the only people who would help me. So when I was
receiving food and shelter from the Church it hardly seemed right to
challenge their &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; . Besides I knew not a lot
about the Christian faith even though I raised as Roman Catholic and
was a altar boy. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So if the
Church taught me that end time prophecy was in a particular mould
then who was I to argue and challenge? I accepted the whole teaching
hook line and sinker. Of course being Christian fascists they did not
give alternative views. It took me nearly 40 years to figure out that
there are alternate views. By this time the orthodox view had time to
really sink in deep. It used to be called indoctrination or simply
brainwashing! They did a good job. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Of course
noone would even pray for my heroin addicted girlfriend....just think
if we had prayed for her she might have got saved , and even her
family and friends.....but nothing happened ...i guess I was a
scandal as I was having sex with my girlfriend. But noone prayed for
her. But then why pray for a hopeless case? With what I believe now I
think she should have been prayed for if nothing else. Now nothing
may have happened. On the other hand you never know. Stranger things
have happened. But I was too na&iuml;ve. I never challenged the
authority of the Church. The Church was right and that was that. If
she was evil then that was that. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So
philosophy and theology. On the other hand someone once said  what
has Jerusalem to do with Athens? </FONT>
