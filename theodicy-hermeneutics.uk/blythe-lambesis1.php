<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>I noticed
that there was a placeholder but no content.....at the time I was
quite impressed with both men. But for some reason I never got around
to making a comment. Of course noone gives a damm!! Especially mere
males apologizing!! Fake apologies!!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>And of
course they may have been fake But then everything may be fake. Even
Jesus Christ! Which is what the muslims claim about Christ. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But never
mind all that back to Blythe and Lambesis. Both men allegedly
admitted liability and responsibility for their actions and
apologised. Blythe was accused of a murdering a fan by pushing him
off the stage. And of course Lambesis accused of attempting to murder
his wife!! Blythe went back to CZ where the allegeded murder took
place. And faced the court trial for the murder of the fan. He was
even eventually reconciled with the family o f the mudered fan. He
didnt have to go to CZ. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Lambesis
after he was released...one year after his release.....issued a
apology. In the apology he said he waited for one year, so that it
could be seen that was not trying to curry favour with the courts. I
found it a very moving apology. Of course his critics said he made
the apology to gain favour. Who knows? Maybe he did!! But the fact
remains unescapeably  that he publishd a written apology. His
sincerity of course remains a matter of debate. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But in
rock and roll a mainly arrogant male domain, for such apologies to be
issued is a rareity. Unfortunately for Lambesis he was on to have his
entire band leave him!! Even Lambesis admits he has problems!! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>I liked
Lambesis and his band when they did the album &ldquo;An ocean 
between us&rdquo; and especially the track &ldquo;Nothing left&rdquo;.
Which for me was a compassionate track about the hated outsiders. Of
course not everyone will see it that way.  </FONT>
