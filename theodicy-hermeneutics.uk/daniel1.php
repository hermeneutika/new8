<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>The book
of the Prophet Daniel. Books exist of this there can be no doubt. So
why disparage the Book of Daniel. Of course one can reject the
authenticity and the divine claims on this Book. Just another fake
religious book with no relevance or meaning except to aging
antiquarians and historians. Still surely a legitmate area of
interest for even a mad extreme minority. </FONT>

&ldquo;Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy
city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make
reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness,
To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy. <SUP>25</SUP>
&ldquo;Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of
the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince,
There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be
built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times. <SUP>26</SUP>
&ldquo;And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but
not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a
flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined. <SUP>27</SUP>
Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the
middle of the week Daniel 9:24-27</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Are the
above words the very &ldquo;oracles of God&rdquo; or the drug induced
ramblings of a degenerate? Surely the &ldquo;empirical&rdquo;
position has to be one of agnosticism as one has no empirical proof
either way. Listen to Sir Robert Anderson in &ldquo;The Coming
Prince&rdquo; </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Reason may
bow before the shibboleths and tricks of priestcraft&ndash; &ldquo;the
voice of the Church,&rdquo; as it is called; but this is sheer
credulity. But if GOD speaks, then skepticism gives place to faith.
Nor is this a mere begging of the question. The proof that the voice
is really Divine must be absolute and conclusive. In such
circumstances, skepticism betokens mental or moral degradation, and
faith is not the abnegation of reason, but the highest act of reason.</FONT></P>
