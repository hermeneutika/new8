<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Finally a
few words on the &ldquo;dismal science&rdquo;.......surely if
economics was  really a science then surely we would have solved the
economic problems once and for all......As a young man I was a
Marxist. I seemed to need some explanation of the problem of
economics and the constant shortage of money. So back in those days
capitalism was the problem and source of the problem. &ldquo;From
each according to his ability and to each according to his needs.
&ldquo;....But then the French Sociologist Emile Durkheim talked
about the infinite desires of man. So who knows or cares?! But if
people like Marx or Keynes could spend their lives generating
economic theories.....and still we have global poverty. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Even after
Bretton Woods &hellip;....so Government has not solved the economic
problem. The Universities have not solved the economic
problems.....in fact it seems that the economic problems have not
been solved.....and global poverty and hunger continues. Of course if
&ldquo;science&rdquo; is &ldquo;science&rdquo; and economics claims
to  be a &ldquo;science&rdquo; then if we have used the so called
&ldquo;scientific method&rdquo; to solve say the transport problem,
and it works every time. You turn the key in the ignition and off we
go. You turn the light on every time and the light works every time.
So why cant we apply some tried and tested economic principle and
produce economic prosperity for all? </FONT>
