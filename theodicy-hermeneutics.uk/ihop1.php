certainly was taking no heed. I believed Mike Bickle and Misty
Edwards. I seem to recall that Misty Edwards said she had given up a
chance of a marriage and good career in order to &ldquo;serve the
Lord&rdquo;. But in reality she was getting a good salary from IHOP
and had commited adultery at least twice. And had been caught with
both drink and drugs!!! I should have known as I once saw a interview
with her when she was talking about dating. She had a very worldly
attitude towards it, not what I thought was becoming of a prominent
Christian leader. However I shut myself down as I thought these were
wrong thoughts to have. But actually I was right. But I did slightly
separate from IHOP on the whole issue of end times prophecy and the
fact the Bickle if not IHOP were teaching that the Church would go
through the Tribulation period mentioned in the book of Revelation. I
disagreed with that position. Also faith/word taught the same. So
while not being in with IHOP one hundred per cent, I admired their
24/7 live prayer room. Heck I even gave them money!!! But did not
give serious heed to what I was following. It seems I was completely
without discrimination and discernment.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
