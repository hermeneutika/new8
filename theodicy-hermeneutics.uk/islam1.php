<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Getting
into the discussion about Islam. Since Sookhdeo is now devalidated
due to the fiscal/sexual scandals attached to his name....who knows
if he is guilty or not...only God.....but even the whiff of a scandal
and these days one is &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo;. And my main &ldquo;goto&rdquo;
was Sookhdeo. So finally I have to go elsewhere. And Joel Richardson
seems to be without scandal. It would seem that if scandal is
attached to a person then even if they speak the &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;
they are rejected due to the scandal. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So now I
have Joel Richardson and of course Dr Jay Smith and also Dr David
Wood. But then of course Dr David Wood has scandal attached to his
name also, due to his imprisonment prior to his confession of faith
when he assaulted his father. But then Christianity itself would
perhaps teach the forgiveness of sins?? But if that is true then
perhaps even Dr Sookhdeo can be forgiven if he is guilty of whatever
sins he is accused of. So in most TV court dramas at least, a attack
is usually made on the &ldquo;credibility&rdquo; of the witness.  </FONT>
