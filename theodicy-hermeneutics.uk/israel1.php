<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>When I was
a youth all the older ex national service men said to me that there
will never be peace in the Middle East. Looks like they were right.
That is correct. That was more that a opinion it was a correct
understanding of the Middle Eastern situation. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So how is
the circle squared? If one is even to begin to understand the
situation in the Middle East(ME) the concept of God cannot be left
out. A secular analysis is just not sufficient or up to the task.
Surely then a understanding of Judaism,Christianity and Islam is also
required. And this must of necessity involve a understanding of the
hermeneutics of each faith. And then how is it even possible to
arrive at a &ldquo;true&rdquo; understanding of the conflict. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Of course
I missed out &ldquo;satanism&rdquo; and atheism. So who has the
correct perception of the problem area. And how is one to know which
is correct? For me the only Person who really knows is the Almighy
God. Everyone else is faking it till they make it. </FONT>
