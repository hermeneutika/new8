modernity or wherever we are today in 2026. Perhaps it post modern
culture? Or post Christian? Who cares? But I for one need to know
where I am and where I am going. What is a Christian? What is a
Church? Who has the true answers? Maybe I quote Aristotle? &ldquo;The
unexamined life is not worth living.&rdquo; Someone may say who the
hell is Aristotle? But surely as soon as that question is asked there
is no authority. Just a vast sea of opinions. Billions of opinions,
As some wit is alleged to have said, opinions are like
armpits.....everyone has one. And if this is actually the
case.....then my opinion is just as valid as anyone elses</FONT></P>
