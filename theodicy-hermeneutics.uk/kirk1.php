<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Its now
about six weeks since the Charlie Kirk murder. Prior to his murder I
had never heard of him. I may or may not have watched the odd video
but I don't recall doing so. I was horrified at the murder, and also
horrified at some peoples reaction to the murder. Even as a teenager
many decades ago we always said &ldquo;don't speak ill of the dead&rdquo;.
But that now seems to have gone out of fashion, even in the Christian
Church. Maybe I totally misunderstood Charlie Kirk, but I got the
impression from him that he was into encouraging dialogue between
opposing views. Also in one interview with Charlie Kirk he was asked
the question about how he would like to be remembered. He responded
by saying he would like to be remembered for having a strong bold
Christian faith. </FONT>
