<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Had my new
ebike stolen on Sunday 13 July 2025 &hellip;.from outside a
&ldquo;prayer-meeting&rdquo;......!!!!! I am now seven days away from
the event. There is no insurance payout. I told them the ebike was
not connected to a permanent object, hence the insurance terms were
not met. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>This was
security breach on my part. I ought not to have gone to Stockport in
the first place! I was scheduled to finish cleaning my flat. I should
have politely refused, I was otherwise engaged. In other words NO
THANK YOU. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So I am
still dealing with the emotional aftermath of the no small loss. I am
still gutted. Gaining sympathy from others doesnt seem to really
heal. This is a wound, wounds take time to heal and recover from. </FONT>
