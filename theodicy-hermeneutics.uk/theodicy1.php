<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>I am not too sure about
Theodicy outside of Christendom. But then Buddhism posits that all
life is suffering as one of its Noble Truths. But certainly
Christianity has to face the problem of a kind and loving and
merciful God in the face of extreme evil and suffering. Eg all the
wars. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So at the Church this Good
Friday we were introduced to the idea of &ldquo;lament&rdquo;. Of
course in a meaningless universe such things have no meaning Or
rather a Godless universe. In a Godless universe nothing
matters......but if God exists and not only God but the Christian
God, then we have a problem of logic(thats how I see it).....logic
would surely say &hellip;.how can God be all powerful and also God be
all loving....and yet do nothing in the face of evil? Its surely like
me having a machine gun , and yet I dont use it to kill a load of
merciless killers, and just watch as the innocents are mindlessly
slaughtered. Surely if I behaved in such a fashion I would be
condemned? Why? Where does the sense of &ldquo;morality&rdquo; come
from? Why should anyone care if the innocents are brutally
slaughtered and someone who can stop it....does nothing.....so what?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Where does the sense of
outrage come from? If a load of muslims want to massacre a load of
defenceless men women and children......then have at it? But there is
it seems to me a sense of outrage at these things. And not just in
me. After the Manchester bombings I felt a great sense of outrage.
Even though my Church and place of employment disagreed with me I
went on a demonstration. I thought if I could not be outraged at the
slaughter of the innocent at a Grande concert....then I was surely
worth nothing? It was a controversial time. Some people in Manchester
didnt want the demo to go ahead. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;<FONT SIZE=5>Easter&rdquo;
Sunday 20 April 2024</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Still the problem of evil
suffering pain and death keeps coming up. I am relatively comfortable
where I am. Yet one has only to switch on the tv,surf the net or read
a newspaper to find out that not all peoples are so comfortable.
War,famines,diseases,earthquakes,droughts.......Not all peoples are
having a &ldquo;happy Easter&rdquo;. Some have said that there are
more than enough resources on this planet to feed and house
,educate,give medical assistance etc to everyone on the planet. We
have all our large multinational organizations like the United
Nations etc and yet we still have real problems...eg apparently
according to the news sources....the Sudan is having the worst crisis
ever if the news feeds are to be believed. </FONT>
