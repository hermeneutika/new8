is Theodicy?</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">I
am not too sure about Theodicy outside of Christendom. But then
Buddhism posits that all life is suffering as one of its Noble
Truths. But certainly Christianity has to face the problem of a kind
and loving and merciful God in the face of extreme evil and
suffering. Eg all the wars. </font>

Friday 18 April 2025 </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">So
at the Church this Good Friday we were introduced to the idea of
“lament”. Of course in a meaningless universe such things have no
meaning Or rather a Godless universe. In a Godless universe nothing
matters......but if God exists and not only God but the Christian
God, then we have a problem of logic(thats how I see it).....logic
would surely say ….how can God be all powerful and also God be all
loving....and yet do nothing in the face of evil? Its surely like me
having a machine gun , and yet I dont use it to kill a load of
merciless killers, and just watch as the innocents are mindlessly
slaughtered. Surely if I behaved in such a fashion I would be
condemned? Why? Where does the sense of “morality” come from? Why
should anyone care if the innocents are brutally slaughtered and
someone who can stop it....does nothing.....so what?</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Where
does the sense of outrage come from? If a load of muslims want to
massacre a load of defenceless men women and children......then have
at it? But there is it seems to me a sense of outrage at these
things. And not just in me. After the Manchester bombings I felt a
great sense of outrage. Even though my Church and place of employment
disagreed with me I went on a demonstration. I thought if I could not
be outraged at the slaughter of the innocent at a Grande
concert....then I was surely worth nothing? It was a controversial
time. Some people in Manchester didnt want the demo to go ahead. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">“<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Easter”
Sunday 20 April 2024</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Still
the problem of evil suffering pain and death keeps coming up. I am
relatively comfortable where I am. Yet one has only to switch on the
tv,surf the net or read a newspaper to find out that not all peoples
are so comfortable.
War,famines,diseases,earthquakes,droughts.......Not all peoples are
having a “happy Easter”. Some have said that there are more than
enough resources on this planet to feed and house ,educate,give
medical assistance etc to everyone on the planet. We have all our
large multinational organizations like the United Nations etc and yet
we still have real problems...eg apparently according to the news
sources....the Sudan is having the worst crisis ever if the news
feeds are to be believed. </font>
