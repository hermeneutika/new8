&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Words cannot
begin to express how deeply sorry I am for the hurt that I have
caused. There is no defense for what I did, and I look back on the
person I became with as much disdain as many of you likely do.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First, I apologize
to my former wife and remarkable children for my appalling actions.
There&rsquo;s not a single day that goes by where I don&rsquo;t wish
I could undo the damage I caused, and out of respect for their wishes
I will not discuss anything else about them (now or in the future). I
also ask anyone reading this to promote healing for them by
respecting their privacy and defending them from any negativity or
anger which should be directed towards me. I was the sole offender
and the only one to blame for everything that happened.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To my family, I
apologize for the trauma you faced and may still feel. This is an
ongoing sentence many of you serve because of me. I am so sorry to my
friends who were betrayed by everything I hid from them and all the
hardships I caused people who used to work with me. Band mates, road
crew, managers, attorneys, agents, label people, and more all had to
suffer through many unexpected changes because of my actions. While
they were dealing with the aftermath of my arrest, I responded toward
many of them with bitterness that I should have directed toward
myself. I know that I can&rsquo;t undo the animosity I brought their
way, but I hope to mend what I can now as time goes on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To the people who
looked up to me as an artist, I let you down in so many ways. I tried
to show my best side to the public, while feeding an ugly growing
monster behind closed doors. I wrote lyrics about the person I wanted
to be rather than the person that I was. I was living a life that
lacked empathy and viewed everything through a self-motivated lens.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I cannot say for
certain what life looks like going forward as so much is different
now and I&rsquo;m still learning. Music always has and always will be
a part of me, and has helped me get through the darkest parts of my
journey. However, this apology is not a part of promoting anything.
Rumors circulate, and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve learned to
accept, but this apology is just that, an apology to everyone around
me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I&rsquo;ve remained
silent to the public since expressing remorse at my sentencing
because time seemed like the best way to promote healing. Today marks
the first opportunity to freely apologize without any motivation to
gain favor from the courts, as I have now completed the entirety of
my legal sentence (including the completion of all parole/probation
requirements). Let it be clear that no amount of time served can
right my wrongs. I do not feel deserving of a second chance and am
not asking for anyone&rsquo;s trust. The way many people feel about
me makes sense, and only time will tell if my future actions line up
with my remorse, something I pray for every day. In the last five
years, the ripple effect of all my actions has extended further than
a written statement can address. Thus, I will continue to apologize
in both words and actions moving forward.</FONT></FONT></P>

reading, Tim&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
