<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Started
writing on 5 March 2025. Ukraine ,Russia and the USA are over all the
news channels, the internet and every political and religious pundit
that exists. A billion and one different opinions. Surely it is
impossible to come to any decisions concerning this mess? There is no
place to get accurate information. All lie &hellip;..there is no way
of ascertaining what is truth and what is not. All attribute motives
to all the key players with really knowing what indeed their true
motives are, they project perhaps their own feelings onto others...it
used to be called &ldquo;projection&rdquo; in psychological terms. Ie
one attributes to ones adversaries the character traits one has
&hellip;.because it is easier to blame others that change oneself. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>Where does
one get ones vantage point. Why was Putin &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; to do
what he did? If indeed he did what was alleged? Why was Trump and
Vance allegedly &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; to &ldquo;bully&rdquo; the
President of Ukraine. &ldquo;Wrong&rdquo; according to who or whom?
Who can actually say what has actually in reality gone on? Faulty
diagnosis is equal to a faulty solution. Years ago in the
manufacturing industry there used to be something called a &ldquo;Root
Cause Analysis&rdquo;(RCA). What is the root cause of the conflict in
Ukraine? Who knows? Who really knows?</FONT></P>

Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from
your desires for pleasure that war in your members? <SUP>2</SUP> You
lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You
fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask. <SUP>3</SUP>
You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend
it on your pleasures. <SUP>4</SUP> Adulterers and adulteresses! Do
you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an
enemy of God. <SUP>5</SUP> Or do you think that the Scripture says in
vain, &ldquo;The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously&rdquo;? <SUP>6</SUP>
But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: &ldquo;God resists the
proud, But gives grace to the humble.&rdquo; James 4:1-6</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>From this
perspective all are guilty before the Creator. The RCA for this and
all problems is sin. And according to the Christians the solution to
the sin problem is the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Putin is
wrong. Zylenski is wrong. Trump is wrong. Zylenski cannot fight this
war without Amerikan military equipment. It looks like only Amerika
can enforce its opinions. In other words might is right. </FONT>

I returned and saw under the sun that&mdash; The race is not to the
swift, Nor the battle to the strong, Nor bread to the wise, Nor
riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time
and chance happen to them all. <SUP>12</SUP> For man also does not
know his time: Like fish taken in a cruel net, Like birds caught in a
snare, So the sons of men are snared in an evil time, When it falls
suddenly upon them. Ecclesiastes 9:11-12</FONT></P>

sure seems like victory in battle and wealth goes to the strong. But
then does/did Ukraine have the favour of God? </FONT>
